# Marginal Workers in Tamil Nadu: Applied Data Science Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data related to marginal workers in Tamil Nadu using applied data science techniques. Marginal workers are individuals who are employed for less than six months in a year. This README file provides instructions on how to run the code and outlines any dependencies required for the successful execution of the project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **data**: Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis.
- **code**: Includes all the code files for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **results**: Stores the results and outputs generated during the analysis.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Other dependencies specific to the project (mentioned in code files)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/marginal-workers-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd marginal-workers-project
```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `code` directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

7. Open the relevant notebook (e.g., `marginal_workers_analysis.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be stored in the `results` directory. This may include visualizations, summary statistics, and any other relevant outputs.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy coding!
